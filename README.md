Things made to help me process data from wet lab experiments.

# About the research project
My research at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) focuses on the effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) on prostate cancer (PCa) via modulation of macrophage activity and metabolism.
To study this, I perform many in vitro experiments using cell culture and techniques related to molecular biology.
However, my experiments produce a fair size of data to process manually.
Furthermore, manual processing of my data is not as consistent or replicable as writing and running programs.
To address these issues, I've begun learning more about data processing and coding.
This repository was made to house the hopefully helpful tools I'm building for myself and my lab.
